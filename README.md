# Heart-Disease-Detector
This project merges two ML models: one predicts Coronary Artery Disease (binary) using heartdisease.csv, and the other detects Arrhythmia types (1â€“15) using arrythmia.csv. It provides a unified interface to upload data and get combined predictions for comprehensive cardiac risk profiling.
